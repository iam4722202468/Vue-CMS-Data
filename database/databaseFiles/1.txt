A processors’ execution cores require access to enough memory throughput to ‘feed the beast'’ with data, and doubling the cores without access to more memory channels could present performance challenges. In fact, AMD’s highest-end Threadripper, the second-generation Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX has just that problem because some of the cores lack direct memory access. It’s somewhat acceptable in a workstation part, but starving cores in a mainstream CPU line of direct memory access would be a bad idea, and one we suspect AMD is smart enough to avoid."

However, AMD has confirmed to us that while the new Rome processors are compatible with motherboards designed for the first-gen chips, it will require new motherboards to fully support the PCIe 4.0 standard. That means that while the new 3000-series Ryzen chips may support PCIe 4.0, you'll likely need a new AM4 motherboard designed to accommodate the more stringent PCIe bus signaling requirements. Otherwise the processors will default to PCIe 3.0 signalling rates."
