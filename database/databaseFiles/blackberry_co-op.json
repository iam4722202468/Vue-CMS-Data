We developed an open source benchmark tool that I am allowed to talk about called Ultimate Benchmark for Container Image Scanning (UBCIS). UBCIS is a benchmark for detecting the scanner performance in terms of precision and vulnerability coverage on most common Linux Docker basic images. UBCIS can evaluate your scanner and score it using statistical notations of precision, recall and f-measure. UBCIS can also run a set of scanners on a set of container images and smartly merge the results without you worrying about the setup."

Vulnerability scanners are important because docker containers can be build on other containers, some of which use base containers that are rarely updated. Vulnerabilities can be found in base containers that indirectly make your container vulnerable, which some people may not realize. At Blackberry, these scanners were benchmarked and compared to each other. The results from the project I worked on can be seen in the paper on the Github project page!"
